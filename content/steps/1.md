## Contracts

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. Each contract can contain declarations of State Variables, Functions, Function Modifiers, Events, Struct Types and Enum Types. Furthermore, contracts can inherit from other contracts.

There are also special kinds of contracts called libraries and interfaces.

The section about contracts contains more details than this section, which serves to provide a quick overview.


```JavaScript
contract SimpleStorage {
    
}
```
